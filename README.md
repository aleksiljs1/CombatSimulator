# Overview
This project implements the **Factory Method Design Pattern** in TypeScript to simulate combat. After a move is picked , the characters main health is incremented by the damage of the move the program would pick. The project makes it simple to create and configure new moves without altering existing structure.

### Technologies used
*Typescript*  and *Node JS*
### Usage
run the code using Node.js
```bash
npm run start
```
example output :
```bash
Combat is starting
Fireball has hit for 40 damage
Player has 60 health remaining
Combat is starting
Fireball has hit for 40 damage
Player has 20 health remaining
```
